# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-10)

- New: native Claude Code Mod (`hooks/register.ts`, TypeScript, no build step). Wraps Bash `tool.call`, prunes long output in `assist` mode, keeps `stderr` intact, stores the untouched original, and adds a read-back pointer.
- New: `/jev status | doctor | readback <id>` commands (no model turn).
- New: pure TypeScript core in `core/` (config validation, pruning, Jev response validation, hashing), byte-for-byte parity with the Python core checked against a shared golden fixture (`scripts/gen_golden.py`).
- New: session marker `mod-active/<hash>`; the classic Python hook skips sessions the Mod owns, so nothing runs twice. Older Claude Code without Mod support still gets the classic hook.
- Fix: removed `defaultEnabled: false` from `plugin.json`. With it, a `--plugin-dir` load registered neither the module nor the hooks. Projects stay opt-in through `.claude/jev-agent-kit.json` (`enabled` defaults to false).
- New: `scripts/release_check.py` local release gate; project-only `release` skill; expanded `operate` skill.
- Security/correctness (independent audit, all fixed, each with a regression test): redaction now catches Bearer/Basic tokens and quoted/JSON secrets (they previously reached the Jev API); both cores use identical ASCII-only regex semantics and count code points; retention is enforced when the Mod owns the session; `delivered_chars` no longer claims savings for results that were not rewritten; project-root hash resolves symlinks; `JEV_STATE_DIR` must be absolute (`~` and `~/` only); every new state directory is `0700`; git failure no longer reports a known repo state; secret scan catches quoted/JSON keys and non-UTF-8 files.
- Tests: 72 Python + 48 Mod/core tests (`claude plugin test`).
- Removed: GitHub Actions workflow (no CI quota); the local gate replaces it.
- Not done: model routing (`agent.spawn`/`turn.step`), real Agent-task benchmark, live Jev API validation.

## 0.1.0

- Baseline: Python stdlib core, classic hook adapter, log pruning with read-back, loop observation, smoke, bench, paired report. Packaging: MIT license, marketplace manifest, `operate` skill.
